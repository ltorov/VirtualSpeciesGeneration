## General Information
This project aims to generate virtual species as a crucial complement to species distribution models (SDMs). SDMs often require validation with real-life species data, which can be challenging and biased. Virtual species are created by defining their niche as a function of environmental variables and simulating species occurrences on a given map. This project is written entirely in Matlab and aims to explore the variable space and generate variability in the simulated species to test the accuracy of SDMs.


## Data

The environmental variables data in this project should be in .asc file format and contain the environmental variables in a given area. The data should be stored in the data folder in the following format:

- Each environmental variable should be stored in a separate .asc file.
- The .asc files should contain the values of the variable and the coordenates.

An example of the environmental variables data files is available in the data folder.
